            Welcome. The point of this gallery is not just to save my Web Design grade. 
            It is also a place for me to store the memories I've made over my time in high school.
            I like to think of this as a monument to me, my friends, and our journey.
            Please peruse and enjoy.
        </P>

            Now I know what you're thinking: "Wow this is extremely low effort. This web page looks like
            something from the earliest days of the internet." Well you're kind of right. This isn't low effort,
            it's mostly low skill. 
        </p>
